description: "After completing this quick start guide you'll have generated and tested an authentication token that can be used in all subsequent requests to the Piloterr API."

## Create an Account

Head over to the [Piloterr Dashboard](https://piloterr.com) and follow the steps to either log in or create an account.

## Get a Token

1. Once inside the dashboard, click **API**.

2. Click **New**.

3. Provide a name for future reference, and any notes perhaps describing a use
case, then click **Save**.

4. You'll be presented with a new token in text and a button to **copy to clipboard**. Tap the copy button, and paste the token somewhere safe.

<Tip>
    On this dashboard, you will be able to see the logs and know how many requests you have made.
</Tip>

## Test

To test our new token, open the Terminal and prepare our environment using the
following command, replacing `<TOKEN>` with the actual token generated from the
Piloterr console in the last step:

```bash
export PILOTERR_TOKEN="<TOKEN>"
```

This saves us from copying and pasting the token every time we need to use it, and we can now make a call to the Piloterr Usage service:

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: $PILOTERR_TOKEN" https://piloterr.com/api/usage | jq .
```

Response:

```json
{
    "plan": "API",
    "remaining": "14823"
}
```

This query allows you to obtain the number of remaining requests.

<Note>
    Most examples throughout this documentation will assume you have set the `$PILOTERR_TOKEN` variable.
</Note>

## Conclusion

You've now managed to authenticate with the Piloterr API using a generated token.

At Piloterr we strive to be a developer first platform for global scraping API. Itâ€™s important for us that the barriers to using our APIs should be as low as possible with clear and complete documentation. Having said that, our project is and will always be a work in progress, so if you do have any issues or require further clarification, please use the support channel from inside the the Piloterr Dashboard to contact someone from the team.

## Setting up

To get started with the Piloterr API, you'll need to create an account and generate an API key. You can do this by visiting the [Piloterr Dashboard](v2/api-reference/authentication) and clicking on the "API" tab.

## HTTP Status Code 404

Piloterr does not incur any charges for 404 errors related to the [Company Database](/v2/api-reference/database/company) access point. The integrity of the company database remains unaffected. A 404 error is returned when the requested URL cannot be found. This can happen if the URL is invalid or if the company is not present in the database.
